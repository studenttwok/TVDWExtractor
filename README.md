# TV Dreamworks Game Database Extractor

TV Dreamworks 電視夢工廠 (TVDW for short) is a tycoon game that I enjoy a lot.
It was made in Taiwan and published by T-time Technology 光譜資訊 http://www.ttime.com.tw/ in 1999.

I reverse-engineered the game to understand what a tycoon game's dataset should look like.
If you have the game and you are also curious about this, feel free to use this program to explore.

You will need Python to use this program.

It extracts:
* pdata/film.pgm
* pdata/person.dat
* pdata/pintro.dat
* pdata/script.pgm
* table/fresh.tab
